# Bitcoin Prediction - A project that won the second prize in a hackathon

This repository contains all the files our team used in order to create an ipython Notebook for refactored.ai. Refactored.ai is an online platform through which one can learn and build at the same time. It is completely powered by iPython Notebooks and is a result of a 5-cell compiler trick. Our task was to create a lesson on anyone of the following topics :

1. Bitcoin Price Analysis
2. Alpha Solutions Fraud Detection
3. Air Quality Analysis

We picked the Bitcoin Price Analysis whose problem statement was to:
* Ingest the data into a format that is easy for analysis.
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
* Can you predict the future price of the dataset? 

The following marking scheme was adopted:
* Submit the EDA and your solution as a course: 25 points
* Perform prediction of "btc_market_price" on the dataset using regression: 40 points
* Submit to GitHub: 10 points 
* 5 cell format : 20 points + 5 points for Unit testing block

The 5 cell format was a ipython notebook restriction wherein the total project cells were supposed to be multiples of 5. This along with the following pattern:
1. A Markdown cell with the Exercise information and questions
2. A code cell where the user is expected to complete the code
3. A Markdown cell with hints
4. A solution window with the correct code
5. An assertion tab to check the solution entered by the user and compare it with the correct solution
